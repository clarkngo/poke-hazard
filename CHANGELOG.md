## [Unreleased]

## [0.4.0] — 2026-05-07 — Phase 1: Game Foundation

### Added
- **Vite + TypeScript + Phaser 3** project scaffold (`src/`, `index.html`, `vite.config.ts`, `tsconfig.json`)
- **TitleScene** — Phaser scene with live node network animation (60 nodes, proximity edges, glowing packets in green/red/purple), HTML overlay with glitch title, version badge, and full menu
  - New Game → name entry modal → creates and persists save
  - Continue → loads existing save (disabled when no save exists)
  - Import Save → file picker, JSON validation, stamps current version
  - Export Save → downloads timestamped `.json`
- **GameScene** — placeholder screen showing survivor biometric status (HP, Viral Load, Chapter, last save time) with Back to Title and Export Save actions
- **SaveSystem** (`src/game/systems/SaveSystem.ts`) — localStorage persistence, JSON export/import, structural validation, timestamp formatting
- **Save types** (`src/game/types/save.ts`) — `SaveState` interface, `createDefaultSave()`
- **GitHub Actions deploy workflow** (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`) — builds on every push to `main`, copies `dist/` → `docs/latest/` and auto-commits
- `npm run snapshot:phase1` script — builds and freezes output to `docs/phase1/`
- Two-way navigation: homepage `▶ Play Latest` → `docs/phase1/`; game title screen `☣ POKÉHAZARD.DEV` → homepage

### Infrastructure
- `base` path set to `/poke-hazard/` on build, `/` in dev (no broken asset paths in either env)
- GH Pages now auto-updates `docs/latest/` on every merge to `main`
